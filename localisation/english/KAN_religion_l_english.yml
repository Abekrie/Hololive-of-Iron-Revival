KAN_religion_category_desc:0 "Kanata Angelism, also known as Kanatanism, is a religion aimed to worship Amane Kanata. Since the annexation of East India, Kanata had introduced the religion to people in the region. However, in a region that was predominated by Hinduism, Islam, and Buddhism, Kanatanism is not so popular.\n\nKanata decided to enforce Kanatanism as state religion anyway. She will go on to reform the national development policy, where cities that have Kanatanist majority will get more budget than those that are not. This caused tension between the people and the state, and the people's opinions are not very positive...\n\nPeople's opinion on the state:\n§8Buddhism: [?Root.KAN_religion_buddhism|=+0]\n§8Hinduism: [?Root.KAN_religion_hinduism|=+0]\n§8Islam: [?Root.KAN_religion_islam|=+0]\n\n§WReligions in the state\n§9Local religions: §Y[?Root.KAN_local_percent|0]%\n§3Kanatanist Heimin: §Y[?Root.KAN_kanatan_percent|0]%"
